Use the Invisible Ink'r first then the MErger
Change the folder paths when needed:
1. For Ink'r: The folder path of the original image and its microsoft Azure transcription output txt file (all in the same folder)
2. For Merger: The folder path to the original image (the same as the Ink'r path)
3. For MErger: The folder path of the output pdfs from Ink'r
